On this project we will set up Pygame and then create a
rocket ship that moves right and left and fires bullets in
response to player input. Next, youâ€™ll create
a fleet of aliens to destroy, and then continue to refine the
game by setting limits on the number of ships you can use
and adding a scoreboard.
